# Analysis Reports

This directory collects automated analysis artifacts for each development
iteration. Reports summarize semantic diffs, document relationships, and overall
repository health. The data is generated by the NLU documentation pipeline and
the diff analyzer tools.

Key files include:

- **history.log.md** – chronological summary of notable changes
- **diffs/** – semantic diff records for pull requests and releases
- **performance/** – metrics captured during test and build runs

To regenerate the analysis reports manually run:

```bash
./tools/nlu/docs-cli run-all
```

The latest knowledge graph visualization can then be viewed in
`docs/synthesis/visualizations/knowledge_graph_viewer.html`.
