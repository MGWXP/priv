# Documentation Visualizations

This directory contains visualization tools for exploring the repository's documentation structure.

## Knowledge Graph Viewer

The Knowledge Graph Viewer (`knowledge_graph_viewer.html`) provides an interactive visualization of the relationships between documents in the repository. It allows you to:

- Explore the connections between different documents
- Filter by taxonomy layer (config, prompts, code, docs, audit)
- Filter by relationship type (references, implements, tests, documents)
- View detailed information about each document and its relationships

### How to Use

1. Open `knowledge_graph_viewer.html` in a web browser
2. Use the dropdown filters to focus on specific layers or relationship types
3. Click on a node to view its details in the sidebar
4. Use the buttons to toggle physics simulation or center the view
5. Refer to the legend for node and edge color meanings

### Node Types

- **Hexagons (Blue)**: Configuration layer documents
- **Diamonds (Green)**: Prompt module documents
- **Rectangles (Orange)**: Code layer documents
- **Circles (Purple)**: Documentation layer documents
- **Triangles (Red)**: Audit layer documents

### Edge Types

- **Solid Lines**: References relationships
- **Green Dashed Lines**: Implements relationships
- **Orange Dotted Lines**: Tests relationships
- **Purple Dashed Lines**: Documents relationships

## Generating Visualizations

The Knowledge Graph data is automatically generated by the NLU documentation pipeline. To regenerate it:

```bash
# Process the repository and generate relationship data
python tools/nlu/processor.py --base-path . --output-dir docs/nlu

# Generate the knowledge graph visualization data
python tools/nlu/synthesizer.py --registry docs/nlu/document_registry.json --relationships docs/nlu/relationship_map.json --output-dir docs/synthesis/reports
```

This will create or update `knowledge_graph.json`, which is loaded by the Knowledge Graph Viewer.

## Integration with Other Reports

The visualizations work together with the textual reports in the `docs/synthesis/reports` directory:

- **System Overview**: High-level statistics about documentation coverage
- **Documentation Gaps**: Analysis of missing or incomplete documentation
- **Cross-Reference Index**: Detailed listing of all document relationships
- **Validation Report**: Assessment of documentation against quality criteria

For a complete understanding of the repository structure, use both the visualizations and the reports.
