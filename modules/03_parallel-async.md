# Parallel Async Execution Module

## Purpose

This module orchestrates multiple AI tasks concurrently while respecting the execution budget. It ensures that asynchronous operations are properly logged and that conflicts are avoided.

## Prompt

Coordinate tasks using the configured parallel strategy and monitor resource usage. Record progress in `audits/parallel_execution.log.md`.
