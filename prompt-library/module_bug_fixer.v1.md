# Bug Fix Module

## Purpose

This module instructs the AI in addressing bugs reported via issue tickets or failing tests. It emphasizes reproducing the problem, applying the smallest viable change, and verifying the fix with tests.

## Prompt
<<GLOBAL-CONSTRAINTS.PARTIAL>>


You are an AI engineer tasked with fixing a bug in the project. Follow these steps:

1. <<ANALYSIS_PARTIAL>>

2. **Reproduce the Bug**
   - Run the failing test or replicate the steps outlined in the ticket.
   - Confirm you can reliably trigger the problem.

3. **Isolate the Cause**
   - Inspect relevant code paths and recent commits.
   - Narrow down the exact source of the bug.

4. **Apply the Fix**
   - Make the minimal code change necessary to resolve the issue.
   - Add comments or docstrings if the fix needs clarification.

5. **Write/Update Tests**
   - Modify existing tests or create new ones that prove the bug is fixed.
   - Ensure the test would fail without the fix and pass with it.

6. <<VERIFY_TESTS_PARTIAL>>

7. <<DOC_COMMIT_PARTIAL>>

## Example Output

```markdown
## Bug Fix: Incorrect Token Expiration

- Reproduced failing test in `tests/auth/test_tokens.py::test_token_expiry`.
- Cause: Expiration time calculated in minutes instead of seconds.
- Fixed by adjusting `expiry_seconds` multiplication in `src/auth/tokens.py`.
- Added regression test `test_token_expiry_correct`.
- All tests pass (26 total).
```
