# Code Refactoring Module

## Purpose

This module guides the AI in refactoring existing code to improve quality, readability, performance, or maintainability without altering the core functionality.

## Prompt
<<GLOBAL-CONSTRAINTS.PARTIAL>>


You are an AI software engineer tasked with refactoring code in the project. Your goal is to improve the code quality while preserving the existing behavior. Follow these steps:

1. <<ANALYSIS_PARTIAL>>

2. <<PLANNING_PARTIAL>>

3. **Implement Refactoring**:
   - <<STANDARDS_CODE_PARTIAL>>
   - Run tests after each change
   - Use meaningful variable/function names
   - Reduce complexity and improve readability

4. **Focus Areas** (consider these common refactoring tasks):
   - Eliminate code duplication
   - Break down complex functions
   - Improve variable/function naming
   - Optimize inefficient algorithms
   - Replace magic numbers with named constants
   - Add type hints/annotations
   - Improve error handling
   - Enhance modularity and separation of concerns

5. <<VERIFY_TESTS_PARTIAL>>

6. <<DOC_COMMIT_PARTIAL>>

## Example Output

```
## Refactoring: Data Processing Module

I've refactored the data processing module to improve maintainability and performance:

### Issues Addressed:
1. Reduced function complexity in process_data()
2. Eliminated duplicate code in validation functions
3. Added type hints throughout the module
4. Improved variable naming for clarity
5. Extracted utility functions to separate file
6. Converted nested if statements to early returns
7. Improved error messages

### Performance Improvements:
- Replaced O(nÂ²) algorithm with O(n log n) approach in sort_records()
- Reduced memory usage by streaming large records instead of loading entirely
- Added caching for repeated calculations

### Files Changed:
- src/data/processor.py
- src/data/validators.py (new file, extracted from processor.py)
- src/utils/data_helpers.py (new file)

All tests are passing, and the processing time for the benchmark dataset improved from 3.2s to 0.8s.

Test confirmation:
$ pytest tests/data/test_processor.py -v
15 passed in 1.32s
